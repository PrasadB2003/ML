# Emotion Detection App
![Alt text](images/image.jpeg)

This Emotion Detection App leverages machine learning models to classify emotions based on audio inputs. It processes audio files and identifies emotions in the speech, making it useful for applications such as voice-based analytics, mental health applications, or emotion-driven user interaction systems.

## Features
- **Emotion Recognition**: Detect emotions from audio files.
- **Audio Upload**: Upload audio files directly for emotion analysis.
- **Live Prediction**: Get real-time emotion prediction from live audio input.
- **Results Download**: Download the results in a readable format after processing.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between dark and light mode for user interface preferences.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the app.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For the emotion detection model (trained using deep neural networks).
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend for user interaction.
- **Docker**: Containerize the application for easy deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: (Optional) For Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
